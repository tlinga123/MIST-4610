## Problem Description
This project models a fictional college football conference database that manages the operations of the United Collegiate Conference (UCC). The UCC is an entirely imaginary athletic league created for the purpose of this database project.

Each team in the conference competes across multiple seasons, maintains player rosters, employs coaching staff, and plays scheduled games in home stadiums. The database stores key football operations information, including:

Teams and divisions within the conference

Players and seasonal rosters

Coaching staff assignments

Games and schedules

Player performance statistics

The goal of this database is to accurately represent these relationships using a relational data model while enforcing referential integrity with foreign keys. This structure will allow meaningful SQL queries to be performed, such as analyzing team performance, tracking player development, and comparing statistics across seasons.

Although the world of the UCC is fictional, all entities and relationships reflect realistic college football operations.

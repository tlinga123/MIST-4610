## Problem Description
The task is to model and build a **relational database** for the operations and statistics of the **National Football League (NFL)**. The central entities in the model include **Teams, Players, Games, and Coaches**, representing the structure and activities of the league.  

The database will track team rosters, player statistics, game schedules, and scores, as well as coach assignments and performance metrics. This allows us to capture the relationships between players, teams, and games across multiple seasons.  

We aim to accurately model these relationships, generate sample data, and populate the entities with realistic statistics. Additionally, we will perform **functional SQL queries** on this data to provide meaningful insights for team managers and analysts, such as identifying top-performing players, analyzing team performance trends, and comparing game outcomes.
